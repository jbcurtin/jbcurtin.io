                  I always found the science of whales fascinating. The process of humans trying to understand how whales communicate is what I focused in on, when I started to question what it was like to exist as an Autistic Individual. Of course, at the time I didn't know I was autistic, I did however know there was a variance of interpretation before anyone provided the words to me.

                  I've been thinking about the recent video of ICE taking down an autistic hispanic male. As unsettling as it is, the truth is, that is the reality all autistic males have to come to terms with. There will be, at any moment in time, a point where someone will challenge you.

                  It's hard to get along with people with my particular version of Autism. Non-verbalism is not easy to move out and the amount of patience I've had to engage just to endure other people's temperaments is, well. Hard to describe here; not because I can't but because I don't want you to empathize with my negative experiences. Instead I'd like to help you understand the constructive value of being a stone-faced autistic person and cultivate ethical incentives in an organization.

Through utilizing of the scientific method, I challenged the voices of my peers

                  We find our way through school, some of us prosper and some of us struggle. Those who are struggling and are incapable of being reached are often left behind. I am one of those strugglers and the therapy used to get through to me was ABA.. but it was incomplete and I had forgotten about the experience. The people performing ABA Therapy had the best of intentions for me, but the application of it left the wrong emotional imprint and I muted myself out of self-preservation since I perceived the environment I was within as hostile

                  Summarizing the Autistic Experience is futile; and I'm still going to attempt it through understanding my own behavior and the choices I've made to get to this stage in my life. Self awareness is essential to living with the right emotional attachments and removing the wrong emotional attachments. I purposefully minimize the number of choices I make every day in order to keep track of all the social rules set forth by society

                  Generally, socially acceptable, to let people know the reason as to why I would take time off and cancel meetings while still staying active at work through pushing code. Like many Autistic Individuals, I've been reprimanded for my behavior and word selection. It had taken a mental toll on me over the years until my naturally inquisitive nature took over. Through considering multiple facets of lexical and behavioral representation of myself, I've managed to pin down some behaviors which occur in myself that lead to Nuero-typical Hypoxia

                  Its hard to modulate ones emotional state and the pursuit of bringing yourself out of a traumatic experience is a process. Learning how to reduce friction with others can go along way towards correcting the state of affairs in your life and compartmentalizing your emotions is very much a healthy thing to do, because after all, trauma is trauma and the last thing we want to do is rationalize and justify the spread of trauma from ourselves to others

                  tracing crate provides an API to record log messages. When considering what kind of labels to log with the messages, I recommend you take into consideration the importance of omitting sensitive information from the long term storage. If I was an infiltrator in your network, one of the first prizes I'd look the learn more about your network is DNS. The second most valuable prize on your network is a SIEM

                  I've been working on hierarchical lists of cryptographic algorithms and technology frameworks in my spare time and have been spending a considerable amount of time on how to present the information. As much as I like tech data, I don't think the information would be digested well enough using just text. A TreeMap seemed appropriate because I'd like to show/indicate the structure of understanding the information along with the attributes that go along with the information

                  Datetime parsing and rendering sometimes require optimization when iterating over a large dataset. Say you have about a couple million rows of timestamps you'd like to parse into a datatype. It could take some time if you use the wrong `import` or `crate`. In this article, I'll benchmark what it takes to load a couple million datetime stamps with Python's datetime, Numpy, Chrono, and Time

                  By far, my favorite RDBMS is PostgreSQL. Having worked with MySQL, MSSQL, Cassandra, Redis and more; the versatility of PostgreSQL continues to inspire me to write better and more complex SQL. I have a piece of software that reaches out to various news websites following best practices for crawling. Scraping content using provided by the sitemap.xml and following the rules set forth by the robots.txt file. The content of these sites can be anything, but the general approach is to collect as much news as possible to see if I can develop a series of heuristics to provide as technical indicators.
