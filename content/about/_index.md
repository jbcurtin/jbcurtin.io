## EDI, Supply Chain, Finance, D365

D365 OData provides the Database; Python & Go(Lang) used to integrate Purchase Order submissions into D365. A Web-Portal provided to Customers, with the ability to create a Purchase Order and Submit. The Purchase Order turns into a Sales Order inside D365 and in turn our Customer Service team inspects and approves it. Eventurally turning the Sales Order into an Invoice which is sent back to the Customer who created the Purchase Order via the intgration.

## MLOps & Cloud DB

Using offline batch processing, a datastore is available to Data Scientists. Using Jupyter Notebooks or other scripts with authorization, data is made available to the Scientist to Experiment. The Jupyter Notebook or script is provided to an Engineer and the engineer takes the algorithm and puts it into production. Iteration is slow, the main focus of the collaboration revolves around communicating with the Data Scientist developing the algorithm. As data is requested to be added to a Data Lake, access to that Data Lake is activly productized and embedded into production. Providing a seemlees deployment into production, with out Pythonic or RESTful API breaking between systems.

## Product Development

Over 10 years of Product Development experience, including Javascript Frameworks such as AngularJS, VueJS, JQuery, SenchaJS, Scriptaculous, and Underscore. Backend Frameworks such as Flask, Django, and Pylons.

Working for large brands such as National Geographic, PBS, and The Washington Post, I've made successful and meaningful contributations to production systems. Learning from, and teaching others as I go, I've found that the best tool to encourage ownership and leadership skills, is collaboration through iteration.

## Game Development

In my pursuit to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), I found a Game Engine called Bevy. A modest Game Engine with huge potential. From zero understanding of Rust and 3d grahics, while reading code to understand the engine. Produceing a rendering of Chess.
