    "# CronJob management in kubenetes\n",
    "\n",
    "CronJobs were first released by Bell labs in 1975. Used to invoke periodic jobs on a given day, week, or month at a specific hour & specific minute. CronJob kind has made its way into the kubenetes API and are packed full of capabilities not immediately noticeable by one's imagination. Here is a workflow I developed that functions well and also provides a quick way to debug by creating Jobs from CronJobs."

    "Kubernetes `kind: CronJob` controller implementations are somewhat unusual in the way scheduling is performed. The inputs we use are most certainly `cron` specific, but the behaviour of `kind: CronJob` can be excessive. Without properly setting `startingDeadlineSeconds` and `concurrencyPolicy`, the controllor may end up scheduling more than one job at a time. [Kubernetes CronJob](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/#cron-job-limitations) has more details as to why this is. I'm often more pragmatic when implementing and documenting architecture solutions, I'll embed some default values that have worked well for me.\n",
