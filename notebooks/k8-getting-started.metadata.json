    "After years of talking about it, I've started taking the time to really dig into a k8 environment. Having spent most of my career working with AWS. I've opt'd to learn more about GCP this time around. With it, I'm extending my vocabulary and looking into certifications. In the meantime, I'll make regular updates for moving from a Cloud Deployment strategy to Kubernetes."
