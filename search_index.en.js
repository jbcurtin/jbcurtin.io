Rustation. Pythonista. Ecmascribe. MLE.\nThrough my pursuit to understand Machine Learning, I found myself gravitating towards GAIA, TESS, and other datasets collecting astronomical data. The utilization of those datasets remained to far out of reach for me as my immediate goal was to learn how to deploy and operate Machine Learning Pipelines at scale. Therefore I decided to focus on the financial sector where I could learn how to apply Timeseries Analysis and Forecasting to OHLC Charts. Figuring out the concise ways to architect and deploy Machine Learning Pipelines at scale.\nI started my career at PBS and then National Geographic as an Autistic Mute. I was lucky enough to stumble across the opportunity to interview and work with a variety of talented individuals. Being someone who could write code and learn software without much English context, I first studied User Interface design as a Front End Engineer around the time of AngularJS 1.x. Eventually I picked up Python &amp; Django and studied the source code for months to learn how various contrib packages enhanced core software. From Django I started to learn the basics to Reverse Engineering for Web Application Security. Running penetration tests against my servers while reducing attack surfaces. Today I primary focus on defensive strategies and mitigation.\nI went on to move out of America and learned quickly my security skill-set would not be progressively viewed in case of incident. Therefore I altered my abilities and began to focus on Software Architecture and Web Application Development. This was in 2016 when AWS was becoming popular and GCP just started taking part of the market share. As time went on, I found myself writing Python for various startups and enterprise companies. What I lacked though, was the ability to build cohesive relationships with my colleagues. They would constantly complement me and promote my ability, but me not having any success in my personal life building lasting relationships. I didn't have a workable blue print on how to develop and cultivate those workplace relationships. A recipe for disaster that would ultimately lead me astray.\nI decided to learn a new primary software language. I sat down and studied Rust as I had been writing Python for over a decade by this point and was ready for something new. It was refreshing as the Rust Analyzer provided realtime feedback and made learning the language a lot more intuitive.  I also spent a considerable amount of time learning more about Timeseries Forcasting. Picking up the basics quickly, I ran out of datasets to continue improving my understanding. Therefore I changed my personal focus to identify features using OHLC Charts and spent a considerable amount of time learning how to hypothesize with a Linear Regression and onto Probability &amp; Statistics while writing integrations for D365 F&amp;SC using Python &amp; Django for my colleagues. I ceased from struggling to build work relationships, the position allowed me to manage a team and communicate with directors. It allowed me to establish my variation of leadership rather than having to interpret and emulate professionalism of others in order to advance.\nToday in my corporate time I focus on integrating Machine Learning into production pipelines using various best practices learned from the mlops community. I primarily focus on using batch-based operations where models are trained on a dataset and then deployed and validated. Leaving the science and algorithm development up to the Data Scientists, I focus more on the engineering side of things with a thorough understanding of statistical inference to quickly learn the metrics used to evaluate a model and stamp the recently learned-understanding into a pipeline one way or another. Productization of a Machine Learning algorithm into a Web Application takes time and planning and is where I utilize my architectural skills to communicate, document, run the SDLC, and collaborate with interested parties.\n","id":"https://jbcurtin.io/about/","title":""},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/":{"body":"","id":"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/","title":"Performance Analysis"},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/authoritative-feedback-loop/":{"body":"Summarizing the Autistic Experience is futile; and I'm still going to attempt it through understanding my own behavior and the choices I've made to get to this stage in my life. Self awareness is essential to living with the right emotional attachments and removing the wrong emotional attachments. I purposefully minimize the number of choices I make every day in order to keep track of all the social rules set forth by society\nFeedback loops created from our behaviors can result in uncontrollable ripple effects and highlights how emotional consciousness can be transmitted almost unconsciously, until we become more self aware of it. The effects of which have led me to experience multiple facets of life, from being gleefully happy to chronically depressed, while talking with other people. People like to watch my face while I watch their behavior, in hopes of understanding what kind of emotion I'm exhibiting and they're left astonished that I can have a blank expression while I'm feeling a whole range of emotions.. and I think that is a key component about the Autistic Experience Neurotypicals(NT) can't easily grasp. We, including NT, are capable of feeling more than one emotion at a time. Joy/Sadness, Hope/Despair, and so much more\nThe focus of intercommunication between the Autistic Community &amp; Neurotypical Community is through empathy and is a great place to start because in every action we take, we must stay bolted to our emotions as we grow our societies; allowing empathetic connections and to feel for one another while also thanking our ancestors for their contributions to improve our quality of life through their ideation of social rules we must follow\nMany Autistic &amp; Neurotypical individuals have attempted to make a connection with me throughout my life, but in the end I would not be able to sustain the relationship because of the way the connections turned into expectations from both sides. Through an expression of kindness, someone attempts to make a connection with me and we connect empathetically. At some later point in time, that someone who showed that kindness corrects their behavior when an authoritative figure becomes involved, dropping the empathic social contract between that person and I. In result, that behavior is locked away again, as the lighting strike of an authority figure communicating a standard supersedes the empathetic exchange. This is commonly referred to as \"power\". From within the social group, that \"power\" keeps people safe, but when you're outside the safety of that group.. you don't receive the same protections and thats where we autistics find ourselves. With enough of these exchanges, it could have an accumulative effect and dove tail into causing miss-alignment of empathy\nBrining it into example, I frequent coffee shops and I'm very particular about those coffee shops. There are pre-existing social rules that I'm very much aware of and I abide by them. When someone, through the intent of kindness breaks one of those social rules and I respond in kind to them. I have to be prepared for the inevitable correction of an authority figure to affect the empathic social contract between the person showing me kindness and me sharing gratitude in response\nI only drink half of my coffee and I do that for a very particular reason. Therefore, I take the rest home and store it in the fridge for the next day. ( I'm a fan of cold brew coffee ) About two or three weeks back, a barista offered to take my cup for me before I left the coffee shop. I don't know why he offered, but he made the offer and it was interpreted as a kindness. His body language and smile showed kindness and therefore I responded with gratitude, taking the opportunity to share empathy with him. Some time had passed and this new behavior of mine became more consistent, and the feelings from the original act of kindness and exchange of empathy faded. Only the behavior remained and my autistic brain accepted it as a new social rule without running the behavior against my logical framework for social rules relative to authority. I simply basked in the warmth of the mutual empathy. Then I performed the new behavior with an authority figure and it turned from an exchange of empathy into an expectation I had of the establishment. Within days the behavior was corrected in the barista by the authority figure and today I went back to get another coffee, only to be knocked by the correction. The social contract of empathy I had with the barista was abolished. Ouch\nGoing forward, I'll continue to bring home and store my coffee in my fridge. I'll also remember the barista's empathetic social contract and remember it fondly. My response to his denial of taking my cup, was a kindness on my end. Letting him know, I understand things have changed again and that the empathetic social contract we had is now voided and through my kindness and their mistake, I showed mercy to release them from the expectation they set with me originally\nTo me, the matter is closed.. but how can I be certain the barista understood my response as merciful? I can't, and that is in my opinion, the cosmos of misinterpretation we call the Double Empathy Problem\nIf the exchange was correctly interpreted, than its closure for both sides. In the most non-verbal way possible and all I have to do is take my cup of coffee home with me the next time and not gesture to hand it to him again, reinforcing I understood what was communicated to me\n","id":"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/authoritative-feedback-loop/","title":"An Authoritative Feedback Loop"},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/consciousness/":{"body":"Making sense of the world is tedious. I think that is the pursuit we should strive for, to turn over every downed tree or rock and discovering an evergreen or nasty mold can make all the difference in how we decide to proceed.\nThere are numerous factors which go into developing a mindset capable of remaining stiff, yet resilient enough to function in society. Those privileged to grow up in a life with the right amount of challenge, have a sense of security. Those of us growing up in a dysfunctional environment with unorganized challenges, have a harder time acclimating into society. Attempting to build a baseline around trying to understand our own existence, when the information is confusing to us, can take some time to figure out. Becoming aware of useful tugging on your thoughts requires repetition of behavior. Then you have to think about those tugging-useful thoughts and try to piece the thoughts into a concept. Then you need to decide how to behave relative to those thoughts.\nIt's best to start selfishly.\nThe world seems like a chaotic mess to the person looking at a collection of behaviors. Trying to make sense from it, top down, is an authoritative approach. Trying to make sense of it, from within, is far more than what your imagination can conceptualize.\nIt requires a blindness and a sense of familiarity, which society formally filled in with faith. You have to believe in what you can imagine. You also have to act on your imagination in good faith.\nMy inner atheist screamed bloody murder when I came to terms with this.\nMy inner feminist exclaimed, \"Today, down with patriarchy. Tomorrow, down with neurocolonialism.\"\nMy non-verbalism nodded, with the slightest sense of approval.\nWhy is it so hard to believe?\nLet me rephrase that, \"Why was it so hard for me to believe in myself?\"\nI lived in bias and how I augmented my life through focusing on my biases, framed my viewpoints. My viewpoints influenced the memories incorporated into my emotional chassis as I progressed forward. I failed to re-evaluate my viewpoints for a very long time. I also failed at understanding how my biases were to permissive.\nBy too permissive, I mean that I was very amenable. I couldn't see past my own life experience and realize that others relied on each other to hold each other up. Living in solitude for the majority of my life, I got used to holding myself accountable and correcting my own behavior. I never knew other people needed to hold me accountable; I never realized that other people would feel the need to correct my behavior as a gesture of mutual respect.\nIt's a form of vulnerability, holding someone accountable. You share a standard and you expect the person you're sharing it with, to adhere to it. This is the opposite of the autistic centric concept of non-transactability. Some functioning autistics inherently accept that our reality is filled with non-transactional actors and from that, a majority of us don't know how to fit into a social group.\nNon-transactability is the understanding we come to when our emotional chassis is used to make a connection with someone, but that someone is unable to follow through relative to our expectations of the relationship. Somehow as a result, we've developed a way to function in the world without the need of having to hold people accountable. Which is a form of power we have over our peers suffering from the negative effects of neocolonialism. Our natural ability to carry on, gives us a sense of resilience when entering into fierce conversations.\nWhat I think we need to work on together, to move beyond the limitations of our non-transactional mindsets. Is figuring out how to direct our effort into an endeavor while avoiding pathological mindsets.\nThis is why I like capitalism, it provides the vehicle to dynamically change things in a static social environment. Its a social endeavor meant to disrupt the status quo.\n","id":"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/consciousness/","title":"Consciousness"},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/datetime-benchmarks/":{"body":"Datetime parsing and rendering sometimes require optimization when iterating over a large dataset. Say you have about a couple million rows of timestamps you'd like to parse into a datatype. It could take some time if you use the wrong import or crate. In this article, I'll benchmark what it takes to load a couple million datetime stamps with Python's datetime, Numpy, Chrono, and Time\nWe'll explore different architectural considerations and design patterns to improve the ergonomics of using the different software libraries. Providing you with the ability to drop code into your project with minimal effort.\nThere are some considerations to apply when selecting the right datetime alteration software.\n\nLeap Seconds\nLeap Years\nUS Daylight Savings Timezone Offsets\nNanosecond Support\n\nWhere to apply these considerations is an architectural decision, for example storing all datetime strings in a database should be in UTC, would take care of Leap Seconds &amp; Leap years and avoid having to manage US Daylight Timezone Offset. When rendering a datetime string on a webpage using technologies such as VueJS or ReactJS. We can leverage Typescript|JavaScript to transform those datetime strings from UTC into client-facing timezone aware objects. Client-facing browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and Opera know where the user is situated based of their computer system clocks. Therefore, we can pass a UTC datetime string into new Date() and it should render in the correct timezone with the correct offset. Furthermore, we can transform those same UTC datetime strings into Python or Rust and format the objects accordingly in the event we need to render a time-series\nPython's datetime Module\nI find when working with the datetime module, its fast enough to use in a JSON-WebAPI, but to slow when loading, rendering, or generating large amounts of data. Therefore, its very well suited in enterprise projects which would could include like Django, FastAPI, or Flask.\n\nIn the implementation below, there are a series of dunder methods implemented on the DateTimeUTC object. Those methods allow for to transform, subtract, add time to an existing object using timedelta. At the core is the formatting, implemented in a similar way the new Date() object has been implemented in common browsers.\n\nThe format %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z provides a datetime string that new Date() can interpret without having to manage timezones in TypeScript.\n\nOkay, great. Now that we know how to use the datetime module. Let's benchmark the performance of it\n\nAdding the timezone to the datetime object increased the duration of each benchmark by almost a whole second.\n\nAs you can see, loading the timestamp is immensely slower. We can extrapolate meaning from these results. If our JSON-WebAPIs are receiving more than, say 500,000 requests per-second. Than this is probably an area we could improve the API performance. Its just a lot of CPU time spent rendering data. We could also consider assuming every datetime string is UTC and drop handling the timezone entirely. I personally wouldn't do that; mostly because I think it is more pythonic to keep timezone intact. Explicit is better than implicit\nNumpy's np.datetime64 module\nnumpy provides datetime64 which is timezone unaware. Meaning, it won't handle UTC, EST, IST, JPN, or GMT. Therefore we'll need to omit the timezone data. This probably improves the performance of the module and is much more ideal for loading data into a database, rending to flat files, or producing parquet files. Like we did with the DateTimeUTC class, make a Timestamp class to encapsulate logic for datetime alterations.\n\nAs you can see, there is a lot going on. Most of the logic is used for datetime alterations and not serialization. We'll run the rendering benchmark with the same series of timestamps, but down to nanosecond support and without a timezone.\n\nThe results show sub-second serialization; lets find the mean.\n\n371548.3 microseconds on average, which comes to about 37.1548 milliseconds on average for each benchmark. Considerably faster than the datetime module. Which is to be expected, numpy is accelerated using c-code, and the API is in python to make data processing much more manageable. In fact it has been suggested to me in the past, that the for/loop might be whats slowing down this code and not the serialization routine numpy is performing changing the datetime from datetime64 to a string.\nLet's go ahead and run a benchmark for loading the datetime string.\n\nLoading the datetime string shows similar sub-second results. Let's again, find the mean.\n\nDefinitely a performance hit here when loading the datetime string into np.datetime64. However, it is still a significant performance increase when its compared to Python's datetime module.\nMoving into Rust, one of the expectations is our code will run at faster speeds. We also have to consider not all Python is the same. Some Python packages ship with c-code to improve performance. For example, take a look at httptools, asyncpg, and uvloop. All developed by MagicStack. Yeah, I'm kind of a fan of the software. With that said, Rust can still be written in a way to run slower than Python.\nChrono\nChrono was the first crate I used to perform datetime alterations in Rust. As a result I have an affinity for chrono more so than some of the other choices. When I design software in Rust, its primarily for machine-to-machine comms and less for Server/Client-Browser comms. With that said, I have rolled a couple Web Stacks and the builtin serialization implementing serde is used extensively throughout my code.\n\nFor each iteration of 2 million timestamps, which generates considerably faster than Python's datetime module. DateTime&lt;UTC&gt; is formatted into a datetime string with nano second precision. I presume the timezone alterations will account for some slowdown, but I won't test for that because if the software can support timezones, those should be included in the benchmark so that the maximum amount of information indicates the correct coordinate it time, regardless of where you are on Earth.\nThe Deserialization will take TS_FORMAT and rebuild the datetime strings into Rust types of DateTime&lt;UTC&gt;.\n\nI was staggered by the results. chrono is running multiple orders of magnitude slower than Python's datetime module and Numpy's datetime64 module.\nA second pair of Serialization / Deserialization benchmarks to see if there is a performance difference using serde.\n\nAn obvious performance increase using serde. I didn't expect these results, and I hope someone more familiar with the software can point out what why serde can serialize and deserialize DateTime&lt;UTC&gt; quicker than using .format.\nTime\nI haven't used time much. and it seems to be used reliably with a number of dependencies I've started pulling from. Therefore it has been pushed into my radar and I'd like to determine if the software is more performant than chrono.\nThe benchmark will be setup similar to Chrono benchmarks. We'll test formatting OffsetDateTime into a datetime string and back. Then I'll implement serde and see if there is a performance gain or loss.\n\ntime::OffsetDateTime API took me some time to get used to, but it seems to be more idiomatic than chrono, datetime, and datetime64. Which I think is great, but at the same time it makes it hard to find the correct syntax for say, the ts_format variable. I have specified that I'd like to have nanosecond precision, but I have no idea how to set that level of precision using OffsetDateTime::now_utc()\n\nWay better results than chrono datetime string formatting. Fairly close to Python's datetime module's ability to serialize datetime objects. An obvious performance improvement, but still on par with datetime and behind datetime64\nA second pair of Serialization / Deserialization benchmarks to see if there is a performance difference using serde.\n\nOnly a performance hit with serialization information and a very minor performance hit when deserialization. Very impressive.\nComparative Results\nModule / SoftwareAverage Serialization DurationAverage Deserialization Duration\nPython's datetime3 seconds10 seconds\nNumpy's datetime64371,548 ms774,868.9 ms\nChrono8 seconds11 seconds\nChrono &amp; Serde6 seconds7 seconds\nTime4 seconds7 seconds\nTime &amp; Serde5 seconds7 seconds\n\nThe comparative results have me wondering if there is a correlation between the datetime64 and time results. Obviously, if you're going to load large amounts of data. Numpy's datetime64 datetime strings are the way to go for now. I wonder how well datetime64 would perform in a Spark runtime.\n","id":"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/datetime-benchmarks/","title":" DateTime (de)Serialization Benchmarks from Python, Numpy, Chrono, and Time"},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/double-empathy-problem-manifest/":{"body":"It's hard to get along with people with my particular version of Autism. Non-verbalism is not easy to move out of. The amount of patience I've had to engage just to endure other people's temperaments is, well. Hard to describe here; not because I can't but because I don't want you to empathize with my negative experiences. Instead I'd like to help you understand the constructive value of being a stone-faced autistic person that cultivates ethical awareness in an organization.\nTypically people in power need to orient their communication into demanding higher standards and the unfortunate truth about my particular flavor of autism, accurately portrayed by Thaddea Graham in her role in Sex Education. There isn't much room for conversation on my end because the feelings I have around something going wrong are well, intense. The slightest mistake I make could be ballooned into a false reality if I vocally discharge. A majority of people I've been around have zero issue reinforcing what I trigger on rather than what I work towards and that further limits my behavior to a very narrow interaction to get things done. The professional environments I've found myself within have cultivated and attempted to reinforce masking behaviors and I have to actively put a stop to it in delicate and diplomatic ways.\nSomeone was reckless enough to sit in the same room with me and talk to me about my Autism. He was encouraged to do it and this particular individual is someone who is normally kind. My attempts to stabalize the relationship were well, ignored because he was put in a position relative to me and felt as if he had some kind of authority over me. I side stepped his advances to project onto me and tried to help him understand the fallacy of his behavioism. In the end he chose to cross a series of boundaries and verbally assault me serval times. Not because he felt justified to do it, but because an authority figure gave him permission to do it. These people exist and as much as I live up to a golden standard beyond-reproach when it comes to being autistic, there is always someone ready to justify they know more than I do about autism without actually having a conversation with me.\nNormally called scapegoating.\nHe had recently put his child into ABA therapy and me knowing the landscape of Autism. I knew having a conversation with him about the negative effects of ABA therapy are, well, probably unwelcome because he's already in a desperate situation with his child and I don't want to get tangled into that emotional mess with him. As much as I feel for his child and the path he is forcing his child to undertake, I couldn't help but empathize with his plight, as a parent concern for their child. In reality, he showed all the same signs as someone who is trying to function in a world where he too, has a variation of PTSD. Indoctrinated into the belief system of power and the illusion of comfort it provides.\nThis is where my version of Autism makes it hard to progress in life. I'm forced into a behavior pattern which limits my communication to precise and pine-pointed comments. Most people look at me as a white-privileged male first and the conversation of equal rights or gender identity doesn't come up. In actuality, I consider myself an advocate for intersectionality. Childcare however, is a very subjective subject and the only people making headway in the indurstry are the vultures willing to take advantaged of desperate parents.\nExecutives are hard to converse with because they have to remain engaged and focused in a field of variables that cultivate nuero-colonialism relevant behaviorism. I take great care to maintain their integrity because their reputations are earned over a series of events that have brought them the grace of good fortune as they've navigated the ethical landscape yet to be influenced by my more relevant narrative on autism. This is where my version of autism makes it hard to navigate relationships on that level too. I have to learn and respond to their intonation because they speak relative to a team that is inundated with nuero-colonialism. If I introduce an ethical dilemma they can't navigate, then the most likely course is for me to be terminated and the sad truth is. The ABA narrative is at the forefront of their current understanding.\nI perceive \"The War on Autism\" as based on a similar narrative from The War on Drugs and has been framed into the minds of multiple generations, including my peers. Hordes of people thrive on competition in games, sports, virtual; it is a very normal these days. We get better at beating the computer and then we get better at beating each other in the games we play. When it comes to life, we are psycologically positioned to work together as long as we say and do the right things. If however the wrong series of words or the wrong series of behaviors occurs. Social Contracts can break down and everything has to be renegotiated. This happens in companies as a \"restructuring\" or \"lay off\". Numerical quantities are fantastic for knowledge pursuit when tring to understand mathmatical reasoning; but can also serve as a trial to improve when running laps around the track. In a competitive enivornment, qualifiers sometimes become disqualifiers when people become desperate enough to retain what little influance they have if they find themselves disagreeing with you and it can lead to workplace bullying.\nEnlightenment is not enough; fortitude in a society of people educated with the wrong narratives about autism makes things just a little bit harder. It is easy for people to pin behavior on those they disagree with. This is nuero-coloniasm at it's worst, as it demonizes the behavior of another and reinforces the negative affects of behaviorism as a standard to live up to within a social group. Authority figure after authority figure using a person as example on how individuals should behave or should not behave is disheartening. Further by not taking into account the merits and integrity we autistic people breath every day by simply walking into the door and not upsetting the inherited balance to their ideologies and maintaining order within ourselves without suffering from mental illness.\nThere is hope, the reality is, every single person on this planet is good. Even the worst of the worst of us, are good; science is starting to discover all the reasons as to why someone might go bad. The sad truth is, people who can't function need to be cut from the group in order to prevent the group from imploding. What is relievant in a social group may not be relievant to you, but there is also structure in that social group that needs to be respected and if that doesn't align with your ethics, than you should revisit your association to that social group.\nWhat happens when the core-elements of an institution don't align with our unique perspectives?\nHow do we disconnect when the institution is meant to empower us?\nMy non-verbalism took root in me before I became a teenager. Visiting and asking my kindergarten teacher why I wasn't allowed to be a safety patrol officer. At the time, her response was complete and utter shock and I was confused as to why she looked at me that way. Searching deep within myself today, the most relevant answer is that I don't think she was aware that I had an intelligence underneath my Autistic Mask. Furthermore the concept of an Autistic Mask wasn't to be published for at least twenty years after I had asked her that question. In my early twenties, a series of behavior manipulation techniques was used to force me into a group of people that would come to hate me and it was my first social experience outside of school. It was absolutely traumatizing and produced trauma in me that I was able to measure and review using an OpenBCI Ultracortex Mark IV decades later. I managed to recover from the trauma by inventing a therapy, but at significate cost with over 20 years flopping around between activities and the constant feeling of having to be more than what I was. Truthfully I was ecstatic at what I discovered. Physical, verifiable evidence, that what I experienced is producing physical changes. ..why did it take me that long to learn how to undo the damage that was done to me?\nThe attempt to fix me in my early twenties is what broke me. Score one for ABA as it silenced me and pushed me into a pipeline that was suppose to improve my quality of life. In the end, I came full circle with the feelings and challenged the status quo after learning enough about myself. Before I learned what the Autistic Mask is, I was already well aware of it. I knew something was off with my ability to interact with people, because I found myself in conversations meaning to say one thing and then completely saying other things. It didn't take me long to trace the origin of the misalignment from my early twenties and me not having access to those memories.. I had to develop an elaborate emotional map of every relationship I had with the newly minted emotional chassis I had been developing in secret for nearly a decade.\nGifted with the concept of agency in a form of innocence I hadn't seen before. I started to build-out my emotional chassis back in the early 2000s for the first time. The amount of effort it took to assert my inner-self over your Autistic Mask is intangible and I see other autistic people suffering with the same tug of war. I believe our inability to harmonize our Autistic Mask with our innerselves is the primary reason why we have burnouts.\nThe amount of false starts and burnouts I went through to find some kind of way to function; is/was maddening. In time, it became clear to that the only way I could maintain is if I typed and wrote code and practiced decision making around my computer as it became my agent of creation and the mountain of software I've built both open-source and closed-sourced no longer held value to me outside of the people it helped. I eventually gravitated towards an altruistic belief system that allowed me to walk away from a project without attachment and gifted me a sense of disentanglement. One of the first qualifiers I used to identify good executives from bad executives; executives more interested in the building a relationship with you vs executives more interested in the code you're writing for them.\nWith enough of the core of my emotional chassis built and a rudimentary ethical matrix installed in my reasoning. I was now making emotional decisions without showing a hint of emotion. Scientists are looking for visual/facial indications of emotional response in Autistic children passing as allistic. Which is great that we're talking about it, but the writing of the science is already biased as it passively emphasizes the importance of showing an emotional response.. which is another example of nuero-colonialism.\nHow would you start the conversation with an authority figure with the intention to dispel the negative effects of behaviorism?\nEmail me or find me on blue sky\n","id":"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/double-empathy-problem-manifest/","title":"Coworkers and the Double Empathy Problem Manifest"},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/erosion-of-choice/":{"body":"In a joint effort, it is important to establish guidelines between parties so that mistakes don't reoccur.

Eventually it could dove tail into an interpretation of supremacy. The mirror affect of it would be someone at best, having their free will eroded or at worst becoming a supremacist. Either case, both versions of the individual eventually becomes incapable of providing value back to society as a whole because they are unaware of how their emotions have been intentionally wrapped in order to push change into themselves.\nInevitably it could dove tail into any number of misunderstandings which could erode trust between nuerotypes, races, or miscellaneous-prejudice.\nWhat should you do when you find yourself unable to carry out your interests(free will) or unable to absolve yourself of anger(supremacy) towards someone else?\nThe first is obvious, at least it was for me. I imbued myself with servant mindset, as there is an elegance about being a servant. The second is not so obvious, because the negative emotions are harder to work through without attaching to someone or something else.. and thats what you have to do. Attach those emotions to someone or something else, and choose a non-violent solution to resolve. I attached emotions to the words I used, when I realized I was pushed down by someone with misguided intentions.\nWhere do we go from here you might ask?\nI pushed back, I let the other side know that their approach was sloppy and that it needs to be cleaned up.\nScience is about enriching our lives and outliers such as myself are meant to revise our collective understanding to coalesce a better dataset.

PTSD for autism is slightly different than PTSD for others, as it is a catch all phrase used to identify stress of a previous traumatic incident, the reality is, autistic people have a naturally higher chance of this occurring than allistic people when it comes to casual social interactions.\nWhich is why I think we need to talk about it more.\nRun the numbers all you want, at the end of the day, it'll always show that we are naturally marginalized.

Together and everything in between is the human experience.\nAutistic &amp; Allistic individuals live co-habitably on this planet and for us to develop our optimal psychology we must love, hate, endeavour, resign, and tolerate each others behavior as the root goal of our species is no longer meant to survive, but to thrive. A terse rule-system to be deployed would end in chaos as everyone would start to cut each other off. A more permissive rule-system allows us to learn from our mistakes and become better. As a society, we have whole systems put in place to support individuals struggling with their mental health issues. At the end of the day, those struggles are limited to self observation and the representation of those issues are hard to interpret by observers of the behavior\nScience is more permissive and naturally a terse rule-system follower will learn from the thought experiments of those more enlightened in their pursuits of knowledge. Which is why science will continue to thrive, it is embedded into our nature as humans. Our natural curiosity cannot be extinguished, no matter how terse or difficult the environment may be. People following terse rule-systems will try to steal from you, and they will call it that, but the altruism of science is that the information is shared freely. The method though, that takes time to learn and to practice. Don't mistake competition and adversarial growth as an enemy to your agency\nWhat is it like being Autistic in a world setup for Allistics? Well, its actually quite pleasant.. once I got a handle on the inversion of feelings relative to allistics, I started making progress. The hard part was figuring out which rules I could break and which ones I had to leave alone. Further more, figuring out which rules I would broadcast to show mutual understanding that respect goes both ways. The human element is this, we all fear reprimand and we all fear our mistakes will be remembered, as much it might haunt us. The truth attached to those mistakes, only exist within us and serve as a standard on how not to repeated. We need to build an emotional chassis around those mistakes as much as we need our drive to thrive. An imbalance can occur when those who are afraid to lose everything are assimilated into shame culture and facilitate the development of terse rule-systems to sustain\nHumans make mistakes and its that fallibility that makes us so figgin lovable because we empathize with those mistakes just as much as we empathize with so many other emotions and that is why the world works today. For the majority of people out there, love is our primary driver.. however it is often not talked about because it is easily corruptible and so we protect it. We protect ourselves by not talking about it as much as we could talk about it\nThere isn't a clear guide on how to set standards for anyone. Timeout's are the most common thing, but not something that can be done after the person becomes a biological adult. I firmly believe people need to feel included in every regard, but I also hold the belief that if someone is to be included, they need to know how to remain quiet and considerate to the group. At the same time, that person needs to recognize that their participation in the group is only permissible because they follow the social rules that go along with it.. and this is where people, not just autistic people, have trouble interpreting information being spoken\nAutistic people are simply the marginalized group bringing it to the forefront of everyone's attention\nI raise the question. If autistic behavior is an example of what not to do.. then how do we as a group of people, become okay with our behavior, without falling victim the the fallacy of autistic supremacy?\nThink about the implications of that question for a moment, a thought experiment, if you will?\n","id":"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/liquidity-of-feelings/","title":"Liquidity of Feelings & Language"},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/molding-phases/":{"body":"This is going to be, an emotional article\nMolding Phases - Reversing the negative effects of ABA Therapy\nWe find our way through school, some of us prosper and some of us struggle. Those who are struggling and are incapable of being reached are often left behind. I am one of those strugglers and the therapy used to get through to me was ABA.. but it was incomplete and I had forgotten about the experience. The people performing ABA Therapy had the best of intentions for me, but the application of it left the wrong emotional imprint and I muted myself out of self-preservation since I perceived the environment I was within as hostile\nMore than three decades passed and the words of the therapy continued to trigger within me and the lack of continuity in my life left me in repetitive trauma and would influence my behavior until I developed a good enough self-awareness to empirically study and test my own life experience, all internally\nWe constantly talk about changing  and there are a multitude of frameworks out there in order to proved guidance in how to change for the better.. and that is the narrative we follow. Changing the things we say is easy, but changing internal thought processes takes a different set of tools..\n..is where the narrative of change would benefit us, as we humans glide through life not necessarily looking for connection, but looking for a way to cohabitate and collaborate with each other through bids for connection\nAn incorrect emotional imprint can make it nearly impossible to connect with anyone. As thought is the most private experience we can have. Turning thought into action, into behavior, is an expression of a very public thought, of which we have learned from each other ( think about that phrase for a moment )\nMy first social experience out of my house was emotionally devastating and it left a scare deeper than any other I had, previously. I found myself again, on Autistic Twitter, reading the very statements used to demonize me in the eyes of my caretakers were the exact signatures I found to re-align my empathy to how I really felt about myself. From a young age, I was separated, first naturally through being different and bullied and then intently by my caretakers because they internalized that I miss-behaved constantly\nI was one of those Autistic Individuals that didn't mind getting loud and scaring people who upset me, away, because, well, it was uncomfortable. No, the police was never called on me, but I was threatened quite a couple times. Due to the incorrect emotional imprint from ABA Therapy with words such as Context, Behavior, Social Cues, Task, and so much more. I was essentially a modern day Huckleberry Finn in the way I spoke, but the negative emotional imprint was cultivated by my parents because they had unconsciously misconstrued the meaning of the words and the reverberations of the words in the echo-chamber I existed within triggered my mutism\nMy unrealized suffering was further compounded with a terrible reputation, which would permit everyone I came across to use less useful words with me. Teaching me Shit, Fuck, Ass, as if it was part of everyday life and those words would be woven into my psychology. It is kind of surreal when I have a deep faith inside of me and the words I use to articulate my feelings about it are all obscenities\nI became self-aware of this behavior in myself and used Computer Science to rewrite a majority of my Operational English and it worked for a long time. However, the most common criticism I'd come across, would be that my language was to advanced for my peers. Like the smart kid in middle school talking about special relativity or free will. I contemplated the application of computer science to my behavior and made the appropriate adjustments when necessary, and it worked for a while\nI started noticing limitations in the way I could interact with people. I would over exert myself and not know when to pull back. I would constantly apply myself and the only consistent behavior I would perform is the application of changing myself over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.. ..until I stopped\nI suddenly had life experience and a mountain of information to shift through. Thinking back to my high-school career, I sat with my counselor and listened to the importance of setting up a 5 year plan for my professional career path.. which seemed to be going no where at the time and I asked the hard question: Why?\nLike most people, I looked within to see what I could offer the world in return for its continued co-habitation relative to my behavior and the functions I knew how to perform. I had example of good behavior and bad behavior, but what I couldn't reconcile thought-wise, was why would I be seeded with responding to things negatively whenever I engaged with an activity. What would happen if I forced a positive response?\nIn my early twenties, I went through an experience in my life that left me emotionally traumatized and through my desperation of wanting to have a single friendship. I allowed myself to be used as a tool for people to talk negatively and set me as negative example.. My life experience reinforced this perception time and time again, until I started asking questions. People were talking about me in a negative way, and when time came for them to be honest, they shared with me their honesty and it crushed me because the world view I was taught, yet again, was incorrect.. all thanks to the imperfect application of ABA Therapy and the scare from its emotional imprint I had completely forgotten about, but was constantly reminded of\nThe emotional imprint, or the impact of that ABA Therapy experience, would constantly reoccur in my life without warning and without causation. Completely disconnected in my mind from any one relationship, it would become stark reminder of warning, but it was actually meant as help\nWhen in isolation, I found myself at ease with everything and was able to finally relax. Over time, as I got used to my isolation in my late twenties and early thirties, I could, for the first time in decades, feel my emotional state again. The last time I had felt this, was in my Middle School and High School days. It was liberating and it allowed me to emotionally connect with myself again and I started making naturally empathic decisions\nUnfortunately how to circumvent autistic masking is not well understood. The outer-layer of myself behaving one way and the inner-layer behaving another way, over time I would teach my inner-layer to temper itself and gain control over my outer-layer and the apparatuses I used to emerge from my autistic masking was a set of levers and controls to make alterations and adjustments to my behaviors. It became constant for me to pull on these levers and perform trial and error to see what was deemed good behavior and what was deemed bad behavior. I established boundaries and put myself into a box and put a label on it. The then I made a second box and put a label on that one, and a third, fourth, and fifth box.. ..all with labels\nOvertime I discovered that every-time I exerted a force on my outer-layer (autistic masking), more genuine thought would be concisely articulated for others to interact with. Some bad, some good. It wasn't pretty, like a baby crying out.. I was using words to make sense of the world in a very emotional way to turn my language to an exacting frequency that would stabilize me to talk/interact with Nureo Divergent and Nuero Typical minds, unilaterally\nJames Clear's Atomic Habits was the first book I read that described the process I had discovered in myself, to circumvent my autistic masking (outer-layer) and I quickly discovered that the core difference between myself and others is that I've normalized submissive social behavior in myself rather than promoting empathic actions. I was always charismatic, but I could never maintain a charismatic state for a long period of time because I had absolutely zero example of how to develop continuity with people\nThrough my software, I developed healthy habits, completely unregulated. My peers would compliment my code and I would respond with silence because I didn't know how to take a compliment. They'd eventually want me to leave the team and I'd be confused as to why, they always thought my code contributions were worth complements. It didn't occur to me, that my lack of response was something they had issue with. They didn't know how I thought about them..\n.. that is where I started developing continuity\nIt was about this time where I knew I needed to take time off, but due to my inability to communicate effectively, I was in a financial position which limited my ability to take long periods of time off from work. Therefore I had to work.  I resolved to get better at connecting with my colleagues, but before I could. I did a self assessment of my own emotional state to figure out my own emotional needs and what I discovered is that every human on this planet is emotionally driven and that we all have the capacity to feel the same way about something. Not only are we capable of unilateral empathy we're capable of connecting with each other using a minimum set of words and actions. The problem which occured with my ABA Thearpy is that, the community I was apart of tried to hold me accountable for my behavior when my behavior wasn't even wrong to begin with. Which spawned the trama loop that went on for decades. People would hold me accountable and I would spirl at the slightest offence and eventually, even my caretakers gave up\nHere is how I reversed the trauma from ABA Therapy\nI started rebuilding my perception with the following axioms\n\nAll animals are naturally driven to cohabitate\nWhat differentiates Humans from Animals is our ability to make a very complex set of sounds\nOur big brain provides the ability to comprehend complex patterns\nWe share information as a hive-mind and depend on each other, even when divided\nWe developed written language to store information for longer periods of time\nUnderstanding our own Emotional Intelligence is essential to properly sorting information\n\nMy experience quickly turned into empirical observations and I started to sort my life's experience into buckets of actionable habits, regaining control of my behavior and reasserting my command over my own body. I quickly discovered I could alter my own behavior through trigging  a different set of habits rather than shutting down. Through triggering these different habit sets, I discovered that people reacted differently, and slowly I, I discovered that the people around me responded to me positively. Some excited, some perplexed, as my stoicism was well known.. I suddenly showed, an emotion.. and it was correctly interpreted\nPeople gasped and I've convinced myself that it wasn't about me, even though the timing was exact to indicate it was. Still, it was a notable event. I amended to my perception, the following axioms\n\nMost people react and interact to a thing immediately\nThose of us who had a negative experience with that thing, become uncertain with how to react/interact immediately\nThose of us who are unprepared for an experience, often react in a manor which could foster discontinuity\nMost people are quick to point this out\nThose of us naturally become more forward thinking in our responses\nNeuro Divergent and Neuro Typical Individuals who think fast, burnout\nThinking &amp; moving to fast will make us fall forward from our own inertia\n\nI spent years struggling, trying to find the right timing on how to activate my different behaviors in a socially compliant way that didn't erode my identity. As my self awareness increased, I added the following axioms\n\nPeople are self-aware of their own behavior and all have the same capacity for change\nWe all use levers and buttons to effect change in our own behavior\nTruistic people are commonly nicer to you\nTempered people are commonly kinder to you\nUncomfortable people feel as though they have to interact with you, but don't know how to\nI get to choose the intensity of every emotional connection I make with someone\n\nThis is how I reversed negative effects of ABA Therapy in my life. Not through repetition or re-exposure and hoping for the best, but through hard and meticulous effort because you have to command yourself to activate.. even when you don't want to\nTaking small incremental steps, is how we improve the quality of life for everyone on our planet\nOnce you commit to \"it\", pursue it, improve it, mold yourself for it.

Like many Autistic Individuals, I've been reprimanded for my behavior and word selection. It had taken a mental toll on me over the years until my naturally inquisitive nature took over. Through considering multiple facets of lexical and behavioral representation of myself, I've managed to pin down some behaviors which occur in myself that lead to Nuero-typical Hypoxia\nWhen I'm at a party, talking with someone for a really long time sharing a lot of information. I was taught how to do this by other Neuro-divergent individuals who were also experiencing social acclimation issues into a group of people. As I leveled-up my self-awareness, I began to notice what I spoke about, didn't have any emotional or vocational relevance to my world view and I was simply syndicating information from someone who made me feel a particular way. This too, was a learned behavior due to my lack of continuity in relationships with people\nI like to think most autistic children negatively affected by ABA therapy, like I was. Developed a world view which was much more stark than the presentation of struggles provided by their peers. Rather than being taught how to connect with my peers through empathy, I was taught how not to repeat mistakes through criticism and the result of it was a hotchpotch of life lessons which would continue to dominate my internal governance until I built something better. As the words from ABA therapy faded, the emotional state and trauma remained.. dormant to be reawakened by someone passing by in casual conversation\nCompassion fatigue, when I just gave to many shits about another person or something else and I couldn't self-regulate myself into a normal state of governance afterwards. This was a double bladed sword for me to fall onto as my internal governance was cultivated by parents ashamed of my behavior without feeling content in their own life lessons from their childhood. It's common in psychology to declare that parent(s) have messed up the development of a child.. but what about the parents? It's convenient to point to your parent(s) and say they don't know what their doing or what they did; and at which point do you take on the responsibility of their failure and make it your own to correct?\nNuero-typicals in general, just talking with them. Takes its toll, and I'm sorry.. but there is a bio-ware limit to my presentation of Nuero-typical language patterns. On the flip side, I could talk for hours with someone who is autistic and not feel any sort of fatigue.. but that too is a double bladed sword for me to fall onto because I have to eventually switch back to Nuero-typical language patterns\nThere is no socially acceptable way to describe this, yet. There is presentation for me to consider and simply dumping my information on people and hoping they organize my information in a meaningful way that benefits me is expecting to much. Therefore I resolve to isolate myself for a couple days as I recuperate and work through thought-product relative to my life experience and produce language meant to inspire my peers to grow out of these behaviors\n","id":"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/nuerotypical-hypoxia/","title":"Nuero-typical Hypoxia"},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/passionate-yet-sensitive/":{"body":"Finding my inner voice and learning to listen to it has given me the insights I've needed to continue functioning. The world once seemed hostile to me. It wasn't until I said enough is enough, did I take the time to learn a number of methods to test and improve my quality of life. Through utilizing of the scientific method, I challenged the voices of my peers\nThe voice of god is commonly used in meditation and religion text. To me, interpreting that phrase, the voice of god, is more akin to a parent instructing a child on how to behave. It is my belief that all parents want their children to prosper regardless of the upbringing they infuse into their child's psychology. A generally accepted idea in America, at least the version of America I grow up in, is that your child should out-grow your teachings. Internally, when I think about teaching my children, I think primarily about giving them the hardest learned lessons I've learned, in the correct temperance relative to the mistakes they made. They have to learn how to prosper on their own, through following their own interests\nWhether or not a god exists, as defined by Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Shintoism, Buddhism, or Taoism, is beyond my comprehension. What is within my comprehension is the ability to emulate and characterize myself in the stories I'm told about a god in a meditative or religious text. Yes, I think a lot about following my own interests vs following what others tell me to do. You either do too, or you're still masking it through life, in my opinion.. The really lucky of us, manage to develop a vocation around their collective interests. Through like mined individuals identifying each other, crowds form almost effortlessly\nThe transition from listening to a single voice in the crowd to feeling the momentum of the crowd is insummarizable, it must be experienced. For a crowd to prosper, those with the most historical knowledge must take on the duty to remind and reward others within the crowd of the accomplishments the crowd has made together. The prosperity of the crowd is directly reflected by the Emotional Intelligence of the individuals within the crowd. Through promoting our peers, we strengthen our internal voices collectively and we intuitively develop a set of standards to live up to.

Having worked with MySQL, MSSQL, Cassandra, Redis and more; the versatility of PostgreSQL continues to inspire me to write better and more complex SQL. I have a piece of software that reaches out to various news websites following best practices for crawling. Scraping content using provided by the sitemap.xml and following the rules set forth by the robots.txt file. The content of these sites can be anything, but the general approach is to collect as much news as possible to see if I can develop a series of heuristics to provide as technical indicators.\nI've been running the software for about two years now, and a massive PostgreSQL table has been created from the result of it. Today, I'd like to start making regular backups of the data in the table. This article will focus on benchmarking how long it'll take to backup a table using the pg_dump program &amp; Docker.\nStanding on the shoulders of giants, I've found a comprehensive review of algorithms used for compression. I'm not concerned with parallel processing; I'll stick to evaluating the programs as provided. What I'm looking to glean is a definitive and consistent measurement of how long it'll take to export and compress information for the massive PostgreSQL table.\nBenchmark Setup\nBenchmark setup is fairly straightforward. A table called location tracks various metrics about URLs such as crawl_delay, domain of the URL, change_ferq, and lastmod. Properties provided by a sites' sitemap.xml. Which in turn allows for the development of an algorithm to select more relevant pages, yet still allow the crawler to search for archived content while not overburdening the website. The location table will be used to identify the best compression algorithm benchmark for the much larger table\n\nThe database is ran using docker, specifically the postgis:15-3.3-alpine image. Port 5432 is exposed to the host, but we won't use it because it seems that connecting to a port exposed to the host will route traffic through the LAN. Instead we'll export data in the container and compress the output from the exec command to a filepath on the host.\nHow the database has been initialized using Docker\n\nThe compression algorithms to be tested are zstd, gzip, bzip2, lz4, and xz.\nHere is the full script to run the benchmark\n\nBenchmark Results\n\nUnderstanding the Benchmark Results\nA core trade off when selecting an optimal compression algorithm is the amount of time taken; relative to the ratio of the file before compression size over after compression size.\n$$ Compression Ratio = {Uncompressed Size\\over{Compressed Size}} $$\nI'm more interested in the backup running quickly and am willing to accept slightly larger archived files. bzip2 and xz both provided the smallest filesize, but the time to archive took well over twenty minutes for each. ztsd took about a minute and a half, and provided a slightly larger file at 1.6GB in size\nData Stream\nI'm not archiving files. I'm archiving a stream coming from a docker exec command and that has additional overhead to consider. Rather than understanding the overhead, produce a metric for how many MB/s of information is being transmitted from the docker exec command.\nExporting the same stream to dd for about a minute will tell us the maximum TransmissionRate of data being sent to various compression algorithms. Interprocess communication is synchronous between bash processes when using a pipe. Therefore, the TransmissionRate will only be as fast as the compression algorithm can compress the information.\n\nCalculate the UncompressedSize of each archive.\n$$ UncompressedSize = Seconds \\times \\text{Average MB/s} $$\nCalculate the CompressionRatio of each archive.\n$$ CompressionRatio = {UncompressedSize \\over {CompressedSize}} $$\nAlgorithmMathRatioTime\nzstd$$ 88 \\times 105.0 \\over {1600} $$5.7751 minute 28 seconds\ngzip$$ 200 \\times 41.3 \\over {1700} $$4.85883 minutes 20 seconds\nbzip2$$ 1144 \\times 6.6 \\over {1300} $$5.80819 minutes 4 seconds\nlz4$$ 88 \\times 101.0 \\over {2500} $$3.55521 minute 28 seconds\nxz$$ 2262 \\times 3.0 \\over {1300} $$5.2244 minutes 22 seconds\n\nCompression Ratios can vary based on a multitude of factors, most notably is the amount of repeated information in the file being archived. For instance, text data often repeats while random data does not. Therefore we'll be able to achieve higher compression ratios on archives with text data (such as a PostgreSQL dump).\nGood enough\nThe archival software can only archive information at a certain rate. Compression software is generally tested based on how quickly the archive can be generated from a file-descriptor or streaming input. Rather than re-creating those test results, I came up with what I've seen in initial iterations. Something quick that could be refactored at a later time to be more robust. I've also omitted talking about decompression metrics, as the goal here was to identify how quickly the archive can be created. I purposefully left out considerations on file-system performance.\nArticle References\n\nhttps://www.rootusers.com/gzip-vs-bzip2-vs-xz-performance-comparison/\nhttps://linuxreviews.org/Comparison_of_Compression_Algorithms\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression_ratio#Definition\n\n","id":"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/postgresql-compression-benchmark/","title":"Compression Benchmarks for PostgreSQL Archives"},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/reducing-traumatic-friction/":{"body":"Its hard to modulate ones emotional state and the pursuit of bringing yourself out of a traumatic experience is a process. Learning how to reduce friction with others can go along way towards correcting the state of affairs in your life and compartmentalizing your emotions is very much a healthy thing to do, because after all, trauma is trauma and the last thing we want to do is rationalize and justify the spread of trauma from ourselves to others\nWhen I was young, the psychological abuse was extensive. So extensive, it has followed me far into my adulthood where I found the only possible solution to my problems was through meditation and strict moderation of pharmaceutical application. Throughout my life, I've been searching how to fill a hole in my life and about a decade ago is when I found the answer.. and it wasn't easy. Resolution for my own emotional state was in constant flux and I figured out internally that my memories were disjointed and lacked continuity\nI had convinced myself I was unworthy and I was okay with that because I didn't have any immediate goals I wanted to achieve in life. Being content with myself and the best version of myself and just being a good person to people was good enough for me. Over time I found myself gravitating towards writing Software and interpreting the concepts into an ideology. In more personal aspects of my life, I gravitated towards buddhism. Picking all the best parts of it and non of the bad parts of it. My mind, exhausted from involuntary suffering; I latched on to Cognitive Dissonance and would immediately forgive myself and think nothing of the consequences because all humans, regardless of emotional state, have bad habits. I would later learn to recognize this as autistic masking. What I didn't realize, is my feelings of unworthiness were unconsciously influencing my decision making to where I allowed someone into my life and pushed my boundaries to a point where I could recede into myself and exist, but I couldn't develop friendships as a result of it. To prevent myself from doing anything wrong, I became an isolationist.\nI eventually told myself I had been taught all the bad things in life because I was autistic, and different, and all the feels which came with it. My privilege allowed me to get through most of my life without ruffling feathers.. still, it bothered me. I considered myself a friend to everyone and I couldn't figure out how to be friendly with anyone and so I turned my involuntary suffering into voluntary suffering and opened my eyes, ears, and mind to listen to every single person who crossed my path. A gate in my mind and sorted information relative to how I really felt rather than how I was taught to feel.. and without even knowing what autistic masking was, I was already circumventing autistic masking within myself and learning the basics of mindfulness\nFrom an early age, I could see my words caused suffering for others and those observations contributed to my non-verbalism. Having been taught such a mess-of-a-lexicon while growing up and not knowing the repercussions of using such a messy lexicon. People often categorized me in the most heinous category and I would not notice it because it seemed normal to me. My thoughts remained unregulated and forgiving and I simply reserved to keep to myself out of silent protest\nSoftware engineering turned into my haven as the emotional information that often comes along with words were never present in documentation or programs and I began to read open source code in droves. For the first time since playing video games, I performed actions and developed the ability to theorize and learn through trial and error and I, like most other privileged men with lingering emotional damage, developed survivorship bias and built a glass house on top of that foundation\nThere is a sense of foundership which comes along with software engineering. It is a humiliative experience and turns individuals from learning history into recreating history through the application of developing software. It incorporates first learning and then directly applying that knowledge, we read documentation and develop a program to preform a particular action computation.. and thats it. That's all it should be.. however with the lingering emotional damage, its easy to self-medicate using software engineering and develop an ideology without considering the consequences of what it really means to burn down preexisting software infrastructure\nWe develop software to accomplish a specific goal we have imagined. Either to learn more about it or to automate it. The process is the same. We think about it and we create it. Most of the creative effort relies in developing the program and less in developing the idea and that is, in my opinion, a seed for confirmation bias. We don't call it that, but the behavior we performed writing software can be easily transplaced into accepting confirmation bias and when we get used to that pattern and tell ourselves its good, we fail to compartmentalize it and begin looking for that patterning using our neural net\nWhen that feel-good feeling of foundership jumps from the domain developing software into the domain of molding society &amp; recreating policy, it starts edging on pre-existing history already learned from mistakes past. Foundership often without temperance is often tyranny without limits and the kind of governance which is occurring in the United States at this time is celebrating all the [wrong things]. The core difference between the Biden administration and the Trump administration joint sessions of Congress is that the Biden administration focused on progressive topics. While the Trump administration focused on claiming there was a peace agreement for the war between Ukraine &amp; Russia; when there really wasn't any diplomacy established between our two countries.\nIf we forget our past failures and don't allow ourselves to think and learn from those failures, the pattern we've identified as good can be transplaced from tool building into society building and we have to relearn all those hard lessons again and if we're not paying attention, we could start suffering without realizing it.\nIt's not that far of a jump into believing a natural social hierarchy is a good thing\nIt should have been Bernie Sanders VS John McCain in 2016 or Kamala Harris VS Sarah Palin in 2024 in my opinion. Both sides need to improve their playbooks.

There are multiple levels to consider. For the purposes of this article, I'll show how to configure a Self Signed Root CA. You could take in further and install the Root CA and Intermediate CAs into Linux or Windows\nCA Architecture\nCertificate Authority architecture is not as complicated as it might sound. There are however significant security considerations to consider when deciding how services will access adjacent or adjoining services. mTLS between services provides two protections, first by enforcing TLS 1.2/1.3 it reduces the chances of information being leaked. The second the server will authenticate the client when it connects and verify the connecting cert is valid relative to the Root CA. Those two protections are enough to provide good enough security for data in transit. Host Name Verification can be used to further increase security between services; more on that later when talking about Common Name and Subject Alt name.\nCA Architecture has a Root CA protected on a machine only accessible to the DevOps utilities requesting and distributing certificates, a machine only a Developer can access manually, or inside a Cloud HSM service. There is zero necessity to have the RootCA directly exposed to the internet. If however that is the case.. you should strongly consider removing the RootCA from anything that can be accessed through a public IPAddress\n2 Tier CA Architecture\n2 Tier Architecture consists of a RootCA and many service Certificates. In the example below, PostgreSQL, Valkey, and Rocket.rs\n\nOpenSSL provides a command line interface that'll allow us to create the RootCA and services. Let's walk through an example for PostgreSQL\n\n3 Tier CA Architecture\n3 Tier CA Architecture takes it a step further and allows the creation of Key/Cert pairs for Tenants. Anything signed with Tenant A Intermediate CA can only access services from Tenant A. Same for Tenant B, only PostgreSQL B and Valkey B can access each other. Access from PostgreSQL A to PostgreSQL B and vice versa would not work because the connecting Key/Cert pair connecting from either service to the other, would not be signed by an adjacent Intermediate CA\nSimilar to a 2 Tier CA Architecture, the 3 Tier CA Architecture keeps the Root CA offline and should only be accessed by orchestration software or a developer when necessary\n\nThe process for creating an Intermediate CA is similar to creating Service Key/Cert pairs. However, there are specific parameters available in x509, one being the restriction of additional CA creation. We'll cover those values in a follow up article. For new, lets move forward with generating two tenants, each with a PostgreSQL Key/Cert pair\n\nSetup PostgreSQL using Docker\nFor the rest of the article, I'll stick to using a 2 Tier CA Architecture. Let's go ahead and configure PostgreSQL\nConfiguration\ndocker-compose.yml\nAdding storage as a Docker Service in docker-compose.yml provides a bare minimum configuration for a relatively secure PostgreSQL service running locally. The configuration could easily be expanded and deployed using other orchestration software such as GitOps or k8s. The Docker Image used is postgres:17.2-alpine3.21 which is an official image managed and maintained by the PostgreSQL Docker Community\nUsing the latest tag for an image is something you could do, but I recommend pinning to a specific version(:17.2-alpine3.21) so when it comes time to update the software, it doesn't migrate the database from a previous version(16) to the latest version(17) without you realizing it. Automation is great, until it fails and you have to figure out what happened\ncommand in docker compose can override CMD with options or arguments. This is possible because the 17.2-alpine3.21 image uses CMD to specify a default command. &gt;- is the Block Chomping Indicator. It flags a yaml parser to remove newlines from the multi-line string. You'll need to coordinate the filepath location relative to where the RootCA and Key/Cert pair is mounted into the container using a few volume entries in the yaml. Finally, set default environment variables for the username, database name, and password to access the container while its in operation and expose the container port 5432 to 8432 or something more to your liking\n\npg_hba.conf\npg_hba.conf file provides the configuration entry point to secure connections being made to various databases for all or for each user relative to how it connects. For our purposes, we'll want something that is secure enough by asking for two challenges. First set hostssl and require a Key/Cert pair signed by the RootCA created above. The second challenge is enabled by specifying scram-sha-256 instead of trust, which will prompt the connecting clients for a password\n\nThe more details for the hb_conf.conf file are available in PostgreSQL source control. By restricting connections to the one database managed by Docker Compose, attackers will need to guess the exact database name to connect into rather than dropping into a default database. We further reduce the attack surface even more by only allowing dbuser to connect\nConnection Testing\n\nOpenSSL Debugging\nOpenSSL ships with a number of utilities that will help you test your TLS implementation. TLS 1.3 provides a specification that both OpenSSL and rustls implement in order to provide secure connections for transmitting data between services. The specification is also implemented by other languages; I only make a specific note here about OpenSSL and rustls because we'll be using OpenSSL to test rustls in other articles\nopenssl s_client\ns_client will connect to a host using DNS, IPv4, or IPv6 with a Port. Let's use Docker Service storage to test it out\n\nLet's take a look at the diagnostic information\n\nThe diagnostic information provides the full cert chain and verifies the TLS configuration is correct enough for us. What I mean by correct enough, is that we're still using a self-signed cert. That part of the validation will fail, and the part that checks the hostname should fail, but everything else should be fine\n\nopenssl x509\nx509 provides diagnostic information about crt and other files. It's best used when you'd like to learn more about the service your connecting to, or extract more parameters about the CA that signed the certificate\n\n-noout and -text together seem odd together, at least to me. Together, the options indicate to x509 there will be no output such as a crt or csr file and to print diagnostic information about the certification from the -in option to stdout\n\nThere is quite a bit of information to look at, most notably is Validity and information on how the fingerprints and block ciphers are implemented for the Certificate. I've &lt;redacted&gt; anything that makes the output harder to read\nCommon Name(CN) and Subject Alt Name(SAN) extensions provided can be used to verify the hostname against the Server's Certificate to line up with DNS entry or an IPAddress. Traditionally, only Common Name would be used to line up to something like localhost to your server. Subject Alt Name provides the ability to set multiple aliases such localhost, 127.0.0.1, or even pc-name.local. Therefore you'll be able to have as many DNS or IP entries as you'd like\n","id":"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/securing-postgresql/","title":"Secure Connections to PostgreSQL"},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/serde/":{"body":"Implementing Deserialize&lt;'de&gt; on a struct always makes me take a step back.

It can be used to map an error into something Deserialize&lt;'de&gt; will understand.\nFor example, if trying to keep a log of people logging into and out of an application. Tracking that information in a struct Action{event:String} is one way to do it. I personally would prefer to use a Rust enum. The problem though is serde doesn't provide a macro to support enums the way I like to implement.

When considering what kind of labels to log with the messages, I recommend you take into consideration the importance of omitting sensitive information from the long term storage.

The second most valuable prize on your network is a SIEM\nUUIDs offer a natural obfuscation for your labels as they're generally randomly generated or can be constructed to mean something defined somewhere the SIEM doesn't have access to. Additionally you could correlate the UUIDs with primary keys in a database\nLet's get into it with example followed up by description of what's going on\n\ninstrument had two parameters passed into it. name which creates then enters a span and skip which tells which method or function parameters to not include in fields. trace level could also be set, but probably isn't necessary because we'll primarily be using tracing::info!. In the function body of operate_pepper a single log message is recorded: Hello, World\nA single log message is fairly straightforward. I could have used println!, but that would lock up the execution of the program. Reason being, stdout is a globally shared resource. tracing however doesn't have a semaphore to a single resource, which makes it ideal for concurrent programs. It does have some interesting design patterns around atomics which provides an interesting read\nLet's take a look at a program with some concurrency\n\nThere is quite a bit going on in the above example. Creating a JoinSet takes care of scheduling the Tokio Tasks. A closure is used to create a 'static lifetime for the task compatible with Tokio's Spawning API. The async keyword should be intuitive enough to omit immediate explanation. move is used to move idx into the spawned thread which is than rendered in a log message using info!.

The process of humans trying to understand how whales communicate is what I focused in on, when I started to question what it was like to exist as an Autistic Individual. Of course, at the time I didn't know I was autistic, I did however know there was a variance of interpreting me before anyone provided the words, to me.\nBy simply paying attention to what people were saying to me, I was able to decern a pattern of communication that would be soft and remain resilient.\nI stopped to listen to how people projected their perceptions onto me. I think the key difference between who I was and who I am today, is I can stay in the conversation and not struggle to be apart of the conversation. Learning how not to let how another's thought, about me, affect me, took me a while to figure out. Reason being is, people are most interested in getting along. They talk with what they know to be true first and you can either validate their sentiment genuinely or not. People who are extremely perceptive, can tell when you're just saying anything to them rather than responding and thinking about your responses for them, regardless of neurotype divergence.\nWorking with people who are not well practiced in talking with someone who is autistic, takes effort from me. In the autistic community, we put forth the importance of using identify first language. Most functioning allistics without much exposure to functioning autistics have pretty much zero baseline in understanding how to talk with us. They have to start from something that is common to them, which might also feel insulting to us.\nWhat dose this have to do with whales?\nUnlike whales, our voice boxes are very similar to allistic voice boxes. Which allows us to make a lot of the same sounds they do. Allistic brains are a lot closer to our brains, which allows them to understand concepts just as well as we do. Our ears, mouth, and eyes are pretty similar too. We have a lot more in common and our differences help us approach problems with more originality rather than blind conformity, relative to each other.\nThe internet carries our collective words father than our voices ever will.\n","id":"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/whales/","title":"Whales"},"https://jbcurtin.io/search/":{"body":"","id":"https://jbcurtin.io/search/","title":"Article Search"}},"docInfo":{"https://jbcurtin.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://jbcurtin.io/about/":{"body":387,"title":0},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/authoritative-feedback-loop/":{"body":488,"title":3},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/consciousness/":{"body":342,"title":1},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/datetime-benchmarks/":{"body":806,"title":7},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/double-empathy-problem-manifest/":{"body":958,"title":5},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/erosion-of-choice/":{"body":173,"title":6},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/imminent-correction-advised/":{"body":238,"title":3},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/liquidity-of-feelings/":{"body":334,"title":3},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/molding-phases/":{"body":1113,"title":5},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/nuerotypical-hypoxia/":{"body":290,"title":3},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/passionate-yet-sensitive/":{"body":215,"title":2},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/postgresql-compression-benchmark/":{"body":512,"title":4},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/reducing-traumatic-friction/":{"body":581,"title":3},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/securing-postgresql/":{"body":753,"title":3},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/serde/":{"body":192,"title":1},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/tracing-crate-introduction/":{"body":203,"title":3},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/tree-map/":{"body":114,"title":3},"https://jbcurtin.io/articles/whales/":{"body":174,"title":1},"https://jbcurtin.io/search/":{"body":0,"title":2}},"length":21},"lang":"English"}
